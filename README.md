# Tests:
I decided to cover four the most important features on [webpage](https://www.beatport.com/) like:
* switching between many language versions - non english speaking users can use this page too.
* interaction with music player - probably one of the most important funcinality for music store, people like try it something before their decided to but it.
* purchasing music - the same reason - core functionality,  i never see any store when i can't buy products.
* searching music - this's the easiest way to find music what we like.
